Below you have the "Agents" part, wich open the third screen. And still below you have the "shop" category, which is not yet done. After the "Valorant" part, there is the "Other" category. First there is the "Statistics" part, it is not yet done but it is where there will be all the clicker statistics. Second there is the "Settings" part, it is not yet done. And finally there is the "About" part which is not yet done but wich will explain the purpose of the application, and will display the creator of the application (me ;)).
